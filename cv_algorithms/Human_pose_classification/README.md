# Human Pose classification

The Human Pose Estimation (HPE) method is a technique for locating and categorizing the many joints that make up the human body. In its most basic form, it is a method for recording a collection of coordinates for each joint (arm, head, torso, etc.), each of which is referred to as a key point and may be used to define the posture of a person. Combining all the keypoints can help in training models for classifying specific human stances (eg. sitting, standing, laying, etc.)
