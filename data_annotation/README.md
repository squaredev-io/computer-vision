# Data Annotation


## Introduction

The practice of marking data in different formats, such as text, photos, or video, so that computers can interpret it is known as data annotation. Labeled datasets are essential for supervised machine learning since ML models must comprehend input patterns in order to interpret them and generate reliable outputs. ML models under supervision train and learn from properly labeled data to address issues like:

- Classification: The process of classifying test results into distinct groups. A classification difficulty may include determining whether a patient has an illness and categorizing their health information as belonging to the "disease" or "no disease" categories.
- Regression: Creating a link between dependent and independent variables using regression. One example of a regression problem is determining the link between a product's sales and the advertising spend.

## What are the principal difficulties with data annotation?

Data annotation can be done manually or automatically, with or without a cost. However, manually annotating data is laborious, and you also need to keep the data's quality high. Annotation accuracy: Human mistakes can result in poor data quality, which directly affects the forecasting abilities of AI/ML models.
### LabelMe

A visual image annotation tool called Labelme was developed as a result of http://labelme.csail.mit.edu.
It uses Qt for its graphical user interface and is developed in Python. Actually, Labelme is a free software program for annotations that is based on http://labelme.csail.mit.edu. To facilitate manual image polygonal annotation for object recognition, classification, and segmentation, it was created in Python.

You may make a variety of forms using Labelme, such as polygons, circles, rectangles, lines, line strips, and points. Directly from the program, you may save your labels as JSON files. You may convert annotations to PASCAL VOL using a Python script that is available in the Labelme repository.
