# Data Annotation

## LabelMe

A visual image annotation tool called Labelme was developed as a result of http://labelme.csail.mit.edu.
It uses Qt for its graphical user interface and is developed in Python.
Actually, Labelme is a free software program for annotations that is based on http://labelme.csail.mit.edu. To facilitate manual image polygonal annotation for object recognition, classification, and segmentation, it was created in Python.

You may make a variety of forms using Labelme, such as polygons, circles, rectangles, lines, line strips, and points. Directly from the program, you may save your labels as JSON files. You may convert annotations to PASCAL VOL using a Python script that is available in the Labelme repository.
