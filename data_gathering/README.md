# Data Gathering

## Introduction

 Data gathering is the process of collecting, measuring, and analyzing accurate data from a variety of relevant sources to find answers to research problems, answer questions, evaluate outcomes, and forecast trends and probabilities. Our society is highly dependent on data, which underscores the importance of collecting it. Accurate data collection is necessary to make informed business decisions, ensure quality assurance, and keep research integrity. During data gathering, the researchers must identify the data types, the sources of data, and what methods are being used. Below you can find some very useful libraries and tools for data gathering related to computer vision tasks.
